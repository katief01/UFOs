## Overview of the Analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria on the UFO Finder webpage at the same time. In addition to the date, users will be able to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape of the image.

## Results: 
UFO Sighting enthusiasts are now be able to visit the UFO Finder webpage and search for sightings using very specific criteria. New search filters have been added to include the ability to seach by city, state, country, and shape of the image as seen here:

If a user lives in, or will be visiting California, for example, and wants to know what UFO sightings have been reported there, they can enter the abbreviation for California (ca) in the "Enter a State" search field. Once the user presses "Enter" on their keypad, the website will update to show only UFO sightings in California, as seen here:

The addition of filter options on the UFO Finder webpage provides an excellent way for users to search through 100 UFO Sightings across the United States!

## Summary: 
I found one drawback of this design to be in the "Article Title" section, which is 4 columns wide.  There is a lot of wasted space beneath this title.  I would suggest making this section 2 columns wide and listing "Fact or Fancy" below "UFO Sightings:" instead of next to it.  This would leave more room for the article text and allow the search results to be higher on the page.  I would also suggest hiding the last 2 paragraphs of the article (with a "keep reading" option) so that the search options can be located more quickly on the page.
